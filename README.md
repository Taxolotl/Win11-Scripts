## Scripts

### clear 
  ##### For linux users or people who prefer clear over cls. 
  It's just a wrapper around cls

### explore 
  ##### For those who move through their file system with the terminal.
  With no parameters it opens the current directory in file explorer, otherwise it opens the provided directory in file explorer. Supports other file explorers with some customization

### ftpTo 
  ##### For those who use ftp servers frequently and don't want to use a 3rd party ftp client
  Takes 2 parameters:
    1: ip of server
    2: port of server

### ls 
  #### For linux users.
  Prints out all directories, then all files.

### setJavaVer 
  #### For those who use multiple versions of java
  Changes the path's java version. 
  1 parameter:
      javaVersion

## Installation
  1. Download the script(s) you want
  2. Move them to a non-user scripts folder, such as C:\Scripts
  3. Add the folder to the Path. There are lots of tutorials on how to do this already, so I will assume that you can figure that out on your own.
  4. Use the command anywhere!
